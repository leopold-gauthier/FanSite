                <h1 class="h1main">How to be better : Just the essential for win</h1>
                <h2 class="h2main">Counter-Strike is not easy for you , you need to read this !</h2>
                    <div class="news">
                        <h3 class="h3main">Practice logic but maybe miss</h3>
                        <p class="pmain">
                            There are lots of things happening in CS:GO matches, so you might have no time to stay calm and practice aiming and shooting. <br>
                            But it is a worthy training that will pay off nicely.<br><br>

                            You have three options:<br><br>
                            
                            Start the game on community-created maps specially dedicated to aiming.<br>
                            Just search for aim training on the Steam Workshop and try out any map you find interesting. Make this CS GO training your regular practice.<br>
                            Play with bots and try to concentrate only on shooting. Keep the other important aspects aside for a while.<br>
                            Play the Deathmatch mode - it’s a very good practice of fast shooting.<br>                        
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="h3main">Map Control !</h3>
                            <p class="pmain">
                                Beginners in CS:GO may try to bring behavior patterns from other shooters, such as Battle Royale games and this is not how to be better at CSGO. <br>
                                The game is not about just keeping alive and staying together to protect the team. <br>
                                Here you have straightforward goals, and you have to control the map to achieve them. <br><br>

                                Of course, you should know the locations and behave as a team, so this tip is a sequence of the previous two.<br><br>

                                Counter-Terrorists should focus on covering approaches to the bombsites and play patiently in defense. Terrorists should not only rush to a bombsite but also think about clearing the place and then protecting it from any enemies.                    
                            </p>

                        <h3 class="h3main">Bots and Casual Matches before Competitive</h3>
                            <p class="pmain">
                                It’s a special feeling when you jump into CS:GO for the first time and find yourself in total chaos, not knowing what is going on. <br>
                                Perhaps you don’t know where that bombsite is, how the enemies can kill you so quickly, and why everyone is yelling at you.<br><br>

                                The CS:GO community is quite toxic, so you may get an unpleasant starting experience. <br>
                                Practice with bots - it’s a great opportunity to understand the game basics and not become frustrated with your initial steps. <br>
                                But don’t play with bots for a long time. <br>
                                You can remove them at any time by using CS:GO kick bot commands.<br><br>

                                Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a multiplayer game. <br>
                                When you know what to do and can kill at least the easy bots, jump into the Casual matchmaking. <br>
                                Shootouts here do not affect CS:GO ranks, so players are rather forgiving to newcomers - they come here to practice and have fun.<br>
                            </p>

                        <h3 class="h3main">Communicate with Your Teammates the secret of your win !</h3>
                            <p class="pmain">
                                You can be a good player but you can’t win CS:GO matches alone. <br>
                                It’s a team-based shooter first of all (as well as Team Fortress 2), so start developing your communication skills from the very beginning.<br><br>

                                Share your position, inform other players on the enemy actions, coordinate your strategy in each round, and just share your emotions.<br> 
                                This will help to bring you the most powerful excitement. And you certainly will be much more effective in the game.<br>
                            </p>

                            <p class="pmain">That's all for now, apply that and win your game !</p>
